This project is intended to be a suite of personal productivity software that will allow users to more closely track finances and personal goals.
So far, development is planned for the following applications within the project:

- Bookkeeper - an application that allows the user to create various financial accounts and track/categorize credits and debits to those accounts
- Comptroller - an application that allows the user to create and manage various budgets and budgeting strategies
- Auditor - an application that uses data from the Bookkeeper and Comptroller applications to track progress toward financial goals
- Taskmaster - an application that allows users to create to-do lists and goals and track progress toward each
- Praxis - an application that allows users to create and track progress towards the development of daily habits (e.g. diet, fitness regimen, etc.)
